How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me realise the mistakes
that could be done
by programmers for large projects


How could having easy access to the entire history of a
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It reduces the time needed to debug the code after
revisions. Revert to previous versions if necessary.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It leaves the control with the user and
commits are more logical than what is possible
with automatic saving such as google. However
we may forget to save at all and that might 
prove disastrous.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

These systems have interconnected files containing code
Thus, they must be saved togther to maintain functionality.
It is not the case with google docs, where everyfile
does not have any interrelation that will affect its readability



How can you use the commands git log and git diff
 to view the history of files?
 
 git log is used to view the commit history by using git log 
 git diff is used as git diff old_commit_id new_commit_id
 
 
 
 How might using version control make you more confident to make
 changes that could break something?
 
 It reassures programmers of their code and ability to find bugs and revert easily
 
 
 what do you want to try using Git for?
 
 I want to use git as a version control system
 to write code
