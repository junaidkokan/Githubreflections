What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialised, a .git file is created.
It is needed to track the versions of the file
that undergoes changes.

How is the staging area different from the
working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate stage between
untracked files and tracked files. Files are
added there before commit is made. 
This helps to bundle commits of multiple
files together.
