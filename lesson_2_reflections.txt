What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialised, a .git file is created. It is needed to track the
versions of the file that undergoes changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate stage between untracked files and tracked files. Files are added there before commit is made. This helps to bundle commits of multiple files together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
We must add all the files to staging area and them group them by 
commiting as a bulk. This is the use of staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
branches help in giving alternate versions of your project. They might be experimental versions of software

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They make us realize unreachable branches and let us be careful when creating commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
We merge to combine two different codes and features that may be added to the project in different branches. Representing it in a diagram helps us realise the parent commits and unreachable branches.
